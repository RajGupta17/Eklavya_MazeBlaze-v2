# Optical Encoders

## Introduction:

AN OPTICAL ENCODER IS A TYPE OF MOTION SENSING DEVICE that uses light shone through a coded disk to track the movement of a shaft. The encoder provides feedback based on the interruption of light.

## Steps on how an optical encoder provides motion feedback information:

1.  A beam of light emitted from an LED passes through a Code Disk, a transparent disk patterned with opaque lines (much like the spokes on a bike wheel).
2.  The light beam is picked up by a Photodetector Assembly, also called a photodiode array or a photosensor.
3.  The Photodetector Assembly responds to the light beam, producing a sinusoidal wave form, which is transformed into a square wave or pulse train.
4.  This pulse signal is simple:  
    **Light = ON**  
    **No Light = OFF**
5.  The pulse signal is then sent to the counter or controller through the Electronics Board.
    
6.  The counter or controller (not pictured) then sends the signal to produce the proper function (stop, go, rotate, etc.).

## Applications for Optical Encoders:

Optical encoder engines can be **amazingly precise**, with some designs hitting 4 million counts per revolution. This makes an optical encoder a desirable choice where resolution matters, from office equipment like computer mice and copiers to medical equipment. With phased-array technology, an optical encoder is increasingly able to perform in much tougher environments which require a combination of durability and resolution, like crane operations and automated vehicle guidance.
